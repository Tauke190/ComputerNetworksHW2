1.Timeout mechanism not implemented ??
    - Implemented timeout mechanisms for only one packet
2.Difficulty in understanding what has been implemented and what has not been done
3.Is there handshake code implemented in this code ?
4.If there is a timeout mechanism implemented for just one packet , why dont the receiver get the packet after the re-attempts of sending when the mahima uplink or downlink is set to 50%.
5. There might be a re-transmission only when the ack is not received , but if the ack is not sent , it wont intiate the retransmission


Remarks
1. Timeout mechanism is implemented but i received no files on time
2.
